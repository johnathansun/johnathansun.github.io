    <section>
        <p>
            My name is Johnathan Sun. 
            I'm a student at <a href="https://college.harvard.edu/">Harvard College</a> 
            in the Class of 2026 studying <a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/applied-mathematics">Applied Mathematics</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My interests range from policy-oriented economics research to techniques in machine learning. 
            I am particularly interested in developing and applying quantitative methods in the social sciences.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a brief overview of a selection of projects from class and extracurriculars over the past year and a half.
            This does not include current research projects at Harvard Law School and in the Economics Department.

        <h2>Technical Projects</h2>
        <h3>Reinforcement Learning (RL) with ICU Patient Data</h3>
        <p>
            We use the <a href="https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/">MIMIC-IV</a> 
            ICU dataset of 40,000+ patients to 
            define a finite-horizon tabular MDP using max-entropy inverse RL, 
            where clustered vital signs are states and commonly used therapies are actions.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <label for="rl-rewards-and-crit" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="rl-rewards-and-crit" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote">

                Training loss of Delayed Proximal Policy Optimization (DPPO)
            </span> 
            
            Feedback from such an MDP may be significantly delayed across episodes. 
            Hence, we applied RL algorithms with new delay-adapted estimators 
            and evaluated their performance against theoretical guarantees.
            Our project is, to our knowledge, the first implementation of these delay-adapted methods 
            to a real-world dataset.

        <h3>Leontief Input-Output Models</h3>
        <p>
            In this expository piece, we introduce and motivate this category of models, 
            prove that there exists a unique, positive solution, and use 
            <a href="https://www.oecd.org/sti/ind/input-outputtables.htm">2021 OECD data</a> 
            to model dependencies between sectors in the contemporary US economy.

                2018 US economy measured in 2021 dollars. Green indicates the row sector has a higher level of dependence on the column sector. 
                That is, the row sector needs more output (in millions of USD) from the column sector to produce one million dollars worth of their own products.

        <h3>OCaml Interpreter</h3>
        <p>
            I implemented two meta-circular interpreters for a subset of OCaml using 
            substitution semantics and dynamic environment semantics.
            The interpreters support lexical environment semantics and operations on floats and bignums.

        <h3>Milestones in Energy Commodity Markets</h3>
        <p>
            In collaboration with the 
            <a href="https://www.energy.gov/oced/office-clean-energy-demonstrations">Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations</a> at the
             US Department of Energy, we investigated the determinants of capital formation
             in energy commodity markets, particularly natural gas. 
             We show that energy infrastructure clusters around trading hubs,
             that price and volume strongly influence later construction expenditures,
             and that futures trading is significantly correlated with infrastructure investment.

        <h3>Impact of COVID-19 on Air Traffic</h3>
        <p>
            In collaboration with the 
            <a href="https://www.oig.dot.gov/">Office of the Inspector General </a>
            at the US Department of Transportation, we investigated the impacts of the pandemic on air travel to small and rural communities. 
            We analyzed route-level data to discern changes in network dynamics, flight quality, price, and other characteristics.
            We find, for instance, that a few popular vacation destinations were highly disproportionately responsible
            for the "recovery" of air traffic to small communities in the summer of 2021.

        <p>
            In the figure below, we plot the five most frequently visited airports in communities in the bottom quintile of population. 
            The vacation destinations Boseman and Destin have strong spikes in Summer 2021.

        <h3>Apologies for Historical Injustices</h3>
        <p>
            Official state apologies for past injustices have become more frequent since 1990.
            However, some apologies are much more controversial than others.
            I use the US Congressional apology for slavery in 2008 as a case study to examine
            why such apologies are difficult.
            I investigate why people object to these acts, how their objections are grounded in moral arguments,
            and how we can reshape the notion of apology as a more effective gesture of remembrance and acknowledgement.
        </p>

                Apologies have become more frequent since 1990. 
                However, communities impacted by slavery waited over 160 years to see any formal recognition 
                of its harms by the US or UK governments.

        <h3>
            Dog Bans and Property Rights
        </h3>
        <p>
            I wrote a case for the Harvard Business School course <i>Market Perspectives</i> 
            on how dog bans illustrate differences in the handling of property rights, liability, and enforcement around the world.
            In the class, students explored the limits of government regulation on potentially hazardous goods and activities.
